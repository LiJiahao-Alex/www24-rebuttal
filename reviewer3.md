# 1. OCC v.s. SOD
We are sorry that the statement in Section 2 (lines 243-254) may have cause readers the misunderstanding that OCC is completely different from SOD. In fact, we didn't say in the paper that they're completely different. On the contrary, we show in Section III (lines 312-318) that hat OCC is a degenerate case of SOD problem.
