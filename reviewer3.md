# 1. OCC v.s. SOD
We are sorry that the statement in Section 2 (lines 243-254) may have cause readers the misunderstanding that OCC is completely different from SOD. In fact, we didn't say in the paper that they're completely different. On the contrary, we show in Section III (312-318 lines) that the OCC is a degenerate case of SOD problem. With the help of the formal definitions in Section III, we illustrate below the differences and connections between OCC and SOD.

- Difference.
