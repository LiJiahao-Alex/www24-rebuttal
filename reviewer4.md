# 1.Relevance to Web audience

## 1.1 An area in Semantic Web and Knowledge Management(SW&KM)
As reviewer TEpt said, the semantic overflow detection, the content of our paper, is a hot area of the semantic web and knowledge management[A,B,C,D,E,F], which is relevant to the Semantics and Knowledge track of the Web Conference 2024.
>The article is framed in the field of track study. Semantic overflow detection is an area of interest in semantic web and knowledge management. ---Reviewer  TEpt

To the best of our knowledge, the earliest systematic exposition on SW&KM comes from a paper[D] published in WWW 2002.

## 1.2 SW&KM follows the in-framework specifications of Web
The Semantic Web and Knowledge Management are framed within the scope of the Web Conference. Machine learning are introduced here **as a tool rather than a topic**. We aim to address the problem of semantic overflow. There is no way to give up machine learning tools completely, because of their significance to the Web and the fact that adopting machine learning tools is a trend in recent years[G,H,I].
