# 3.Choice of evaluation metrics
Thank you very much for your constructive suggestions, which made us realize that adding some context would better explain the reasons for the selection of evaluation criteria. Limited by the number of pages in the article, we explain in lines 349 to 352 why AUROC is not sufficient for comprehensive evaluation and give the other two evaluation criteria AUPRC and F1 score. We cited reference [24] to help us explain the specific reason, but your comments made us realize that this reduces the smoothness of reading.
